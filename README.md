This project is a serverless Coffee Shop E-Commerce website built using AWS services like:
âœ… AWS S3 â€“ For frontend hosting
âœ… AWS API Gateway â€“ For handling API requests
âœ… AWS Lambda â€“ For executing backend logic
âœ… AWS DynamoDB â€“ For storing product, cart, and order data
âœ… AWS IAM â€“ For managing permissions

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Set Up the Frontend (S3 Hosting)
Develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Create an AWS S3 bucket to host the static website.
Upload frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) to the S3 bucket.
Enable Static Website Hosting in S3.
Set up Bucket Policy to allow public access.
ðŸ”¹ Result: The frontend is now accessible via the S3 bucket URL.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Backend API with AWS Lambda & API Gateway
Create AWS Lambda Functions to handle:

GET /products â†’ Fetch available coffee products.
POST /cart â†’ Add items to the cart.
PUT /cart â†’ Update cart items.
DELETE /cart â†’ Remove items from the cart.
POST /orders â†’ Process checkout and store orders in DynamoDB.
Create an API Gateway:

Create a REST API.
Configure API Gateway methods to invoke Lambda functions.
Enable CORS to allow frontend requests.
Deploy the API.
ðŸ”¹ Result: The frontend can now interact with the backend using API Gateway.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Database Setup with DynamoDB
Create DynamoDB tables for:

Products â†’ Stores available coffee products.
Cart â†’ Stores user cart details.
Orders â†’ Stores completed orders.
Configure IAM roles to allow Lambda to access DynamoDB.

ðŸ”¹ Result: API can now store and retrieve data dynamically.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Implement Cart & Checkout Features
Frontend updates:

Implement "Add to Cart", "Update Quantity", and "Remove from Cart" buttons.
Display cart total price.
Handle checkout process using the /orders API.
Backend Logic:

Verify items in stock before confirming the order.
Store order details in DynamoDB.
Return order confirmation response.
ðŸ”¹ Result: Users can now add, update, and checkout items.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Deploy & Secure the System
Deploy the API Gateway & Lambda functions.
Enable CORS in API Gateway.
Set IAM Roles & Policies for security.
Test the entire workflow (S3 frontend, API calls, DB storage).
Monitor using AWS CloudWatch.
ðŸ”¹ Result: The system is now fully functional and secure.

ðŸŽ¯ Final Outcome
ðŸš€ A fully functional Coffee Shop E-Commerce website! Users can:
âœ… View coffee products
âœ… Add/remove items from the cart
âœ… Place an order
âœ… Store data securely in DynamoDB
